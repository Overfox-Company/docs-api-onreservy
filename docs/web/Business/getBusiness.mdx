Authorization: Bearer token
```

## Responses

###   <span style={{color: "rgb(161, 255, 39)"}}>Success</span>
The API will return the message,  the business list, status and the session token. [business_schema](../../models/business##business)


```ts
[
    business_schema
]
```

In the event that a token is not sent or is invalid, the API will return a 401 status code with the following message:

```json
{
     "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```
in case a user with the token id is not found:
```json
{
     "message": "User not found"
}
```
